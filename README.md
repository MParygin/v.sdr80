#SDR DDC receiver buided on Nexys 2 FPGA board

This project is Software Defined Radio. It builded on FPGA board Nexys 2 with Spartan 3e500 version.
ADC is 16 bit & 80MHz clock.

Features:

* True Direct Down Conversion (DDC) receiver
* Cordic mixer with 0.1 Hz NCO
* CIC decimation
* No FIR
* USB transmitter to PC
* 0-40 MHz bandwidth

On PC side I used <https://github.com/MParygin/platform.sdr>
